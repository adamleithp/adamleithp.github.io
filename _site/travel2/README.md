Blank-Template
==============

A very simple HTML, SCSS and JS template built with minor PHP. It's meant to get you jump started on your new front-end project/experiment or whatever. Instead of wasting time copying files you can spend your time building the next best thing.

The technology used in this template:

-Grunt.js
-Ruby
	-NPM
	-Sass

(I will eventually explain how to install all the ruby gems and other dependencies. For now, you may google and install the listed items above)

How to begin development easily (assuming you have all of the listed items above installed)

	-Open Command line (terminal on OSX) in your this projects root directory.
    -Run: "grunt" (for development)
    OR
	-Run: "grunt prod" (for production)

Happy development!
