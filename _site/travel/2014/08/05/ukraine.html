				<p>When my boss told me and my co-worker that he wanted us to go our office in the Ukraine, I was hesitant to say the least. We all heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17">the tragic Malaysia MH17 being shot down</a> and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/pro-russia-rebels-ukraine-expropriate-ambulances-transport-fighters">pro-Russian rebels in East Ukraine</a>. With everything that is happening in their country, it’s really not a “go-to” destination at all, but after some research, and determining I wouldn’t be flying over / going near East Ukraine, I jumped on a plane the next week.</p>

<h5>We Arrive</h5>
<p>After a 12 hours of travel, We finally land in Kiev, Ukraine. Near customs I’m greeted by big a sign urging people arriving to read about the Malaysia MH17 incident on a provided government run website. Google translating the aforementioned website teaches us what we already knew; The plane flew over a war zone and it should not have been there in the first place. Regardless, I quickly forgot about the whole incident as I was in for a culture shock as soon as we left the airport. </p>

<h5>The Drive to Kremenchuk</h5>
<p>My coworker, Ivan, whom I’ve met before in Canada was in the airport to intercept me and bring us to Kremenchuk, which is about 400km south of Kiev. I was expecting the trip to take about 4 hours considering the KM we had to travel and so I was getting comfortable in the front seat of his Mazda SUV. That comfort disappeared as quickly as Ukrainian’s drive.. Now, I’m not a fear of speed of any sort, I actually consider myself a thrill-seeker- but this was insane. Ten minutes from the airport and we’re already flying at 140km/hr around blind farm corners on the worst roads I’ve ever been on—and that’s saying a lot as I come from Quebec, Canada… Ivan assured us that passing tractors and dodging oncoming—also crazy drivers was the norm, which didn’t ease my mind very much. </p>

<p>After the first hour of the drive, my feet were tired from stomping the imaginary brake and my exhaustion took over and I passed out. I dreamt of nice things, pretty things…slow things. I would occasionally wake up to the sound of a tractor scream by my open window as it seemed to stand still at our speed. So after a 3 hour death-defying drive, we arrive in Kremenchuk—alive. </p>

<h5> [ working and partying... ] </h5>

<p>Here we are on the last day of our 7 days in Ukraine and we’re having a blast. My budget was around $100 a day but it might as-well be $1000 a day because I couldn’t go over that budget if I tried;</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Pint of Beer (Stella): $1.50</p></li>
	<li><p>Full 3 course meal: ~$15</p></li>
	<li><p>Bottle of Vodka (750ml): ~$10</p></li>
</ul>



<p>
We start work at 11am and finished at 8pm everyday to coincide to our Canadian office hours, so with our late starting time each day, my broken-english-speaking co-workers and I partied almost every day… I mean, why not?! It’s so cheap here! </p>

<p>We decided to take our saturday off and the team took us to a remote beach far off into the country… This is my favorite photo from the trip:</p>

<p>I hurt my back in the picture above but I have absolutely no regrets. I had a blast.    After 6 days now, my coworkers are now my good friends and will call them so forever. Really amazing and nice people with so little to offer but gave us so much. I’m leaving with gifts from everyone I met, which includes an <strong>authentic USSR military hat </strong><i>(which I can’t wait to rock it everyday back in Canada)</i> and a Ukrainian Wooden Mace <i>(so sick)</i>.</p>

<p>Ukraine is a very special country with some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. Food was great, the weather was amazing and I will definitely come back if I ever find myself in Eastern Europe. </p>

<p>Oh, and the women are absolutely beautiful. <span class="text--red">&hearts;</span></p>
