				<h3>Documents</h3>
<h5>Everything listed here is fundamental.</h5>

<ul>
	<li><p>passport (duhh)</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>Not so important, but good to have.</h5>

<ul>
	<li><p>Passport photos (you can get these done for cheaper once in Asia, but having them before hand will help you out)</p></li>
	<li><p>Vaccination booklet (no one ever asked to see this, but do bring it with you)</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Equipment / Stuff</h3>


<h5>Big Backpack</h5>
<p>30L - 40L backpack with internal frame.</p>

<p>Almost everyone I saw backpacking around these countries were carrying 55L - 70L bags; I understand everyone travels differently, but bags this big are just not necessary! I brought a Osprey Farpoint 40L and even this may be too big! The only times you're actually wearing these ‘big’ bags is when you get off a bus/van and are looking for accommodations and vice-versa; getting on a bus, which is almost no time at all. The most I spent wearing this 'big' bag was at most 15 minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Osprey Farpoint 40L is carry on compliant with all airlines I have ever experienced. I like to keep my stuff with me when travelling.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I met people only using only a 20L backpacks. These people weren’t dirty, their clothes were (or actually both). You will eventually be this person by the time your finish your first few months, but until then, make the natural transition into bliss like the rest of us. </p>


<h5>Small Backpack</h5>
<p>A very comfortable daypack; 5L - 15L backpack is all you need, this is what you will be using 99% of the time. </p>

<h5>A Headlamp</h5>
<p>One of the most useful things you can bring. </p>
<p>Why do you need this? Walking in the dark and navigating a dark dorm room for your stuff quickly comes to mind. Just keep it in your day pack and you'll feel like a super badass when it comes time to use it.
</p>

<h5>Medical supplies</h5>
<p>Bondades, diarrhea pills, tylenol, advil and rubbing alcohol or salon solution for cuts. I personally never used the pills as I never got sick in the total length of my 3 month trip, but damn did I hand them out to other people. </p>




<h3>Electronics</h3>

<h5>Gopro Hero 3+</h5>
<p>Self explanatory, take pictures/video, connect the iPad to its wifi, download and upload the photos/video to the web.</p>

<h5>iPad (jailbroken)</h5>
<p>Self explanatory. Why I specified the iPad was jailbroken (hacked if you will) is that I downloaded something called "safari downloader" which allowed me to download items off the internet. </p>

<h5>Kindle</h5>
<p>Self explanatory, reading feeds the soul.</p>
<p>I would get eBooks from my iPad which I would then send to my amazon email, which would then be downloaded automatically to the Kindle.</p>




<h3>Clothing</h3>


<h5>Good Footwear (1-2x)</h5>
<p>I used my trusty Birkenstocks, wore them 95% of my entire trip. Comfortable, healthy arch support, high quality fabrication, and Germans will love you for wearing them outside your Haus (house). I bought a pair of Columbia waterproof trekking shoes that I used for... well trekking.</p>

<p>Although the birkenstocks aren't waterproof, I would still wear them out on beach days and boat trips, might be a little impractical that way but if you insist, bring a pair of shitty flip flops. I say “shitty” because I absolutely guarantee you will lose them, it’s just what happens.</p>


<h5>Travel towel (1x)</h5>
<p>Your towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have – I mean backpacker. Any camping towel or a fancy travel towel will do. They are there to dry your wet ass.</p>

<h5>Pants (0-1x)</h5>
<p>Not necessary at all if in warm climates. You will be buying those super baggy pants anyway, because they are just the most comfortable thing you can wear.</p>
<p>I personally brought my trusty climbing pants that could roll up the lefts. These were a mighty useful in northern half of Vietnam (in December the temperature hovers around ~15ºC)</p>


<h5>Shorts (2x)</h5>
<ul>
	<li><p>1 pair of high-tech trekking shorts which that will double as swimsuit. I used a pair of Nike Dry Fits pants.</p></li>
	<li><p>1 normal looking Adidas shorts.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>Shirts (1-3x)</h5>
<p>I cannot stress this enough, you can buy shirts in Asia for 1 / 5 the price -or less- you would pay back home.</p>

<h5>Socks (0-2x)</h5>
<p>This is a luxury if it’s cold in the bus, van or airplane. Basically, if you’re like me- from Canada- you’ll be absolutely fine without socks.</p>
