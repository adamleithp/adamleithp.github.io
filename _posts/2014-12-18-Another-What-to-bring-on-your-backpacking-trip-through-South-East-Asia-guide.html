<p>I'm writing this to inform others like me, who want an idea into how easy it is to travel South East Asia with nothing in your bag.</p>

<p>South East Asia is the perfect place to break into backpacking/traveling. </p>

<p>Before I start, I'm going to emphasize one thing: <strong>You can buy almost everything you need once in Asia- for cheaper</strong>. Things like, ~real~ products, Nutella, peanut butter and poutine will be expensive as it is at home. :( Poutine...</p>


<hr>

<h4>Documents</h4>

<ul>
	<li><p>Passport (duhh)</p></li>
	<li><p>Passport photos (you can get these done for cheaper once in Asia, but having them beforehand will help you out.)</p></li>
	<li><p>Vaccination booklet. Although no one ever asked to see this booklet, bring it with you.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Equipment / Stuff</h3>


<h4>~Big~ Backpack</h4>
<p>30L - 40L backpack with internal frame.</p>

<p>The only times you're actually wearing these ~big~ bags is when you get off a bus/van and are looking for accommodations and vice-versa; The most I spent wearing this ~big~ bag was at most 15 minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Almost everyone I encountered who was backpacking through SEA (South East Asia) was carrying 55L - 70L bags; Everyone travels differently, I just think these bags as far too large for this kind of climate.</p>

<p>I used a <strong>Osprey Farpoint 40L</strong>. It was perfect for carrying the essentials (listed here) and some gifts. <strong>Osprey Farpoint 40L</strong> is a great versatile bag which is carry-on compliant with all airlines.</p>

<h5>Carry-on vs not.</h5>

<p><strong>Keep all your stuff with you when travelling:</strong> Some people like to dump their bags at check-in and forget them, very understandable- but I don't like to do this. My view is that when you check your bag, the chances of your belongings being lost during transtiion potentially jumped from 0% to 100%. Nope, no thanks.</p>

<p><strong>No wait times for baggage carousels:</strong> When you arrive at your destination, you don't have to wait around the metal conveyer belt like the rest of the chumps- no, you get to walk right past these death traps and go right to immigration, no line, no hassle- Beautiful.</p>

<h5>Unleash the hippy...</h5>
<p>I met people only using only a 25L backpacks. These people weren’t dirty, their clothes maybe were, but they're doing it right. After your first few months in SEA, you will eventually become this person: wearing the same clothes each day, not caring if you smell etc. But until then, make the natural transition into bliss like the rest of us. :)</p>


<h4>Small Backpack</h4>
<p>A very comfortable daypack; 5L - 15L</p>

<h5>The most important thing you will carry.</h5>
<p>This backpack is what you will be using 99% of the time. It's your life, it's what leaves the room with you when you go and adventure. I liked a bigger 15L bag as I like to keep: a bigger medical kit on me at all times (Saved me in Myanmar), Go Pro camera with all it's accessories, and a few books.</p>

<h4>Medical Kit(s)</h4>
<p>I have two of these, because when your big bag is stuck under the bus, my day pack comes to the rescue.</p>

<h5>DayPack Medical Kit</h5>
<p>This stuff is on you at all times, </p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Full bottle of Tylenol.</p></li>
	<li><p>An assortment of Bandades</p></li>
	<li><p>Salene solution or rubbing alcohol</p></li>
	<li><p>Diarrhea pills (never used)</p></li>
	<li><p>Anti-Acid tablets. (I never needed these before Asia)</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>~Big~ Medical Kit</h5>
<ul>
	<li><p>Advil (never used)</p></li>
	<li><p>Full package of Bandades, all sizes.</p></li>
	<li><p>Antihistamines (BENADRYL or whatever) for allergic reactions to anything. (never used)</p></li>
	<li><p>Diarrhea pills (never used)</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Headlamp</h4>
<p>One of the most useful things you can bring. </p>
<p>Why do you need this? Walking in the dark and navigating a dark dorm room for your stuff quickly comes to mind. Just keep it in your day pack and you'll feel like a super badass when it comes time to use it.
</p>





<h3>Electronics</h3>

<h4>Gopro Hero 3+</h4>
<p>Self explanatory, take pictures/video, connect the iPad to its wifi, download and upload the photos/video to the web.</p>

<h4>iPad (jailbroken)</h4>
<p>Self explanatory. Why I specified the iPad was jailbroken (hacked if you will) is that I downloaded something called "safari downloader" which allowed me to download items off the internet. </p>

<h4>Kindle</h4>
<p>Self explanatory, reading feeds the soul.</p>
<p>I would get eBooks from my iPad which I would then send to my amazon email, which would then be downloaded automatically to the Kindle.</p>




<h3>Clothing</h3>


<h4>Good Footwear (1-2x)</h4>
<p>Most people have a pair of throw-away flip flops that they use 99% of the time. Personally, I cannot use these as they have no foot support.</p>
<p>I used my trusty Birkenstocks, wore them 95% of my entire trip. Comfortable, healthy arch support, high quality fabrication, and Germans will love you for wearing them outside your Haus (house)!</p>
<p>I also brought a pair of Columbia waterproof trekking shoes. I've tried trekking in Birkenstocks, and it's not so fun.</p>



<h4>Travel towel (1x)</h4>
<p>Your towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have – I mean backpacker. Any camping towel or a fancy travel towel will do. They are there to dry your wet ass.</p>

<h4>Pants (0-1x)</h4>
<p>Not necessary at all if in warm climates. You will be buying those super baggy pants anyway, because they are just the most comfortable thing you can wear.</p>
<p>I personally brought my trusty climbing pants that could roll up the lefts. These were a mighty useful in northern half of Vietnam (in December the temperature hovers around ~15ºC)</p>


<h4>Shorts (2x)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>1 pair of high-tech trekking shorts which that will double as swimsuit. I used a pair of Nike Dry Fits pants.</p></li>
	<li><p>1 normal looking Adidas shorts.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Shirts (1-3x)</h4>
<p>I cannot stress this enough, you can buy shirts in Asia for 1 / 5 the price -or less- you would pay back home.</p>

<h4>Socks (0-2x)</h4>
<p>This is a luxury if it’s cold in the bus, van or airplane. Basically, if you’re like me- from Canada- you’ll be absolutely fine without socks.</p>
