<p>Thailand, have been wanting to be here since I was an early teen and I finally stepped foot into the northern part of country 3 days ago and I couldn't be more excited.</p>

<p>Everyone raves about how amazing Thailand is and notably speaks about a few key tourist attracts that you &quot;must see&quot;. The list of &quot;must see&quot; things to do in Thailand are as follows: sex-trade ping pong show, full moon party, go lie on some doped-up tigers, and ride some mistreated elephants. As you can already tell, I feel very strongly about humans trafficking, animal cruelty and the lack of knowledge surrounding these two issues. With that said, I knew Thailand would interesting. </p>

<p>So, as I was in Chang Mai, which directly translates to ELEPHANT XXXX, naturally I wanted to see some elephants! I quickly start doing some research on the most ethical way to go visit them without perpetuating animal cruelty tourism. Basically that means; avoid places that allowed riding and avoid places that mistreated the elephants. My research was cut short because our very own hostel Baan Khun had pamphlets of an elephant sanctuary. Across the top off the pamphlet for the sanctuary it said in big 20pt font &quot;no riding&quot;, suffice to say I was sold. </p>

<p>Both my travel buddy and I left the next morning for a two day adventure. The adventure consisted of sleeping over inside the native village and the next day proceed to feed, mud up and bathe the elephants a second time, exactly as the day before. Although a bit pricey (~$150CAD), this was exactly what we wanted to do.</p>

<p>Elephant Sanctuary and their elephants</p>

<p>Elephant sanctuary had 3 elephants, a 55year old working bull, a 43 year old pregnant mother and her beautiful 11 month old baby. I quickly examined the giant mammals for any recent scarring as apparently they were supposedly taken in about 3 years ago. Generally, when the elephants are put to work, there are a few telltale signs of their labour: scars on the ears when they are to be pulled in a general direction, hooked in the rear to make them move forward and a very corse upper trunk if they had to push rocks / wood. When I say hooked, I mean they are being hit and punctured by a long fire-pick like stick with a small hook at the end. Thankfully, the big male was the only one who showed these signs of working life. </p>

<p>I cannot determine if this was the only place out of Chiang Mai that treated them like the beautiful creatures they are, but I can safely say that these 3 elephants at this particular sanctuary are treated well. Each of them having their own personal care taker who can communicate instructions to them. </p>

<p>Still working but saved. </p>

<p>The whole aspect of seeing elephants and them being an attraction still sort of bothers me. I should only be able to see these creatures in the wild but the sad reality of the matter is: you cannot see them in the wild anymore. It just doesn't exist here anymore.</p>

<p>The trip in a whole</p>

<p>The experience of this two day trek was amazing. I got to eat with the whole tribe in their raised huts, drink tequila that was made from the rice that was growing 20 meters away and I was treated to the blood moon eclipse above the jungle tree tops. These people have little or nothing and are still so happy. </p>

<p>I can end my backpacking trip now completely satisfied, but I won't. :) </p>
