            <h3 class="title">Marilyn's Missing Books</h3>
            <p>A simple one page project I did for a friend. The purpose of the website is to auction off Marilyn Monroe's -thought to have been lost- two favourite books. </p>

            <h3 class="title">Hollandia Floral</h3>
            <p>A beautiful flower shop in the town of Hudson, Quebec. While desiging the website, getting the feeling correct was imperative; I had to work hard to replicate the homy feeling the family run business delivers once you enter the door. </p>
